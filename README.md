# This will probably serve as my portfolio website
* I can't think of anything I wanna do here that will require a dynamic website, so not gonna use pug.js or react 
* Dockerized
* Don't wanna use a css library for this one
* Saw some method called "Atomic Design", even though my desings suck I wanna give that one a try
* Gonna seperate the scss later as the website grows
* Colors are out of control, going with a smaller, palette
* Not gonna use the sass library I created a while back, writing all brand new
* I want to save the information send by the user via the contact form in my mongodb cloud database 
* setting up babel, check out the babel with sass
* seperate backend files maybe after your break
