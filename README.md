# This will probably serve as my portfolio website
* I can't think of anything I wanna do here that will require a dynamic website, so not gonna use pug.js or react 
* Dockerized
* Don't wanna use a css library for this one
* Saw some method called "Atomic Design", even though my desings suck I wanna give that one a try
